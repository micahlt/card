# Card
### The new business card of the Internet

Card is an open-source project to make creating small, simple web pages with links to email, phone, and social media that are easily shareable.  The final goal is to have two options:

- Host your own Card
- Have your card hosted with a cards.ml/my-name URL

Creating a Card will be easy, with a beautiful UI that lets you choose what you want and don't want to add.
